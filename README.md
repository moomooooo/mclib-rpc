# McLib-rpc
**literally just added a basic discord rpc to mclib for RECIOR** <br />
none of this is mine, mclib is a library, linked below. discord rpc is an rpc also linked below. all i did was combine the two for sm1. <br />
discord rpc - https://github.com/MinnDevelopment/java-discord-rpc <br />
mclib - https://github.com/mchorse/mclib <br />
**instructions** <br />
- in order to change the rpc go to "src -> main -> java -> mchorse -> mclib -> rpc -> Discord.java".
- from here, u can change the discordId to your own as well as timestamps, details, large image, large image text, and state.
- refer to the MinnDevelopment github linked above for help, as once again all i did was add it to this library!
